        Hi there! I’m Srikanth, a Software Engineer and a Computer Science grad student at the University of Cincinnati. I specialize in bringing software concepts to life with clean, efficient code. When I'm not studying or developing, I’m either immersed in a good book or enjoying a game of volleyball. Join me on my journey as I explore the vast world of technology and innovation!
